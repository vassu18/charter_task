Rewards Application - Java backend
Vasavi L, 2023/02/16 


This is an overview of the Java Web Application to fulfill the job requirement Web Application developer.

My Name is Vasavi Lingala (she). I designed and developed this application using Spring Boot (3.0) with H2 Database. 

The gitlab <<<<>>> contains the Java Code for this web application.
Requirement
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

路         Solve using Spring Boot
路         Create a RESTful endpoint
路         Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution

Solution Overview
There are two main flows using REST API (postman) to demonstrate 

Customer (end-user) purchases and the order, payment details are submitted using a REST POST request and creates a new Purchase table row in DB
This also creates another row in the Reward table
Customer can view the rewards points using REST GET (month/cust)
Admin can view the purchases, rewards, customers and products
H2 Database table contents has persisted data
